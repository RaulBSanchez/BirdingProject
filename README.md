# BirdingProject
This project is a personal project that I'm currently working on. It combines my two interests, programming and birding. 

It's currently just a project that I built for myself to check what birds people are seeing around the Wissahickon area. There are many features Iâ€™ll be adding as I get a better vision for what I want this project to consist of. I will move it  from a Tkinter Python app to a full stack application as it progresses. 

Cheers and happy birding.
